YouTube Kids was created to give kids a more contained environment that makes it simpler and more fun for them to explore on their own, and easier for parents and caregivers to guide their journey as they discover new and exciting interests along the way. Learn more at youtube.com/kids

A safer online experience for kids
We work hard to keep the videos on YouTube Kids family-friendly and use a mix of automated filters built by our engineering teams, human review, and feedback from parents to protect our youngest users online.  But no system is perfect and inappropriate videos can slip through, so we’re constantly working to improve our safeguards and offer more features to help parents create the right experience for their families.

Customize your child’s experience with Parental Controls
Limit screen time: Set a time limit for how long your kids can watch and help encourage their transition from watching to doing.
Keep up with what they watch: Simply check the watch it again page and you’ll always know what they’ve watched and the newest interests they’re exploring.
Blocking: Don’t like a video? Block the video or whole channel, and never see it again. 
Flagging: You can always alert us to inappropriate content by flagging a video for review. Flagged videos are reviewed 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Create individual experiences as unique as your kids
Create up to eight kid profiles, each with their own viewing preferences, video recommendations, and settings. Choose from ""Approved Content Only"" mode or select an age category that fits your child, ""Preschool"", ""Younger"", or ""Older"". 

Select the ""Approved Content Only"" mode if you want to handpick the videos, channels and/or collections that you’ve approved your child to watch. In this mode, kids won’t be able to search for videos.The ""Preschool"" Mode designed for kids 4 and under curates videos that promote creativity, playfulness, learning, and exploration. The ""Younger"" Mode allows kids 5-7 to explore their interests in a wide variety of topics including songs, cartoons, and crafts. While our ""Older"" Mode gives kids 8 and up the chance to search and explore additional content such as popular music and gaming videos for kids. 

All kinds of videos for all kinds of kids 
Our library is filled with family-friendly videos on all different topics, igniting your kids’ inner creativity and playfulness. It’s everything from their favorite shows and music to learning how to build a model volcano (or make slime ;-), and everything in between.

com.google.android.apps.fitness,"Get to a healthier and more active life with the new Google Fit!

It's hard to know how much or what kind of activity you need to stay healthy. That's why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.

Activities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You'll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO's recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.

Google Fit will also help you:

TRACK YOUR WORKOUTS FROM YOUR PHONE OR WATCH

Get instant insights when you exercise and see real-time stats for your runs, walks, and bike rides. Fit will use your Android phone's sensors or Wear OS by Google smartwatch's heart rate sensors to record your speed, pace, route, and more.

MONITOR YOUR GOALS

See your daily progress on your Heart Points and Steps goal. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.

MAKE ALL YOUR MOVEMENT COUNT

If you walk, run, or bike throughout the day, your Android phone or Wear OS by Google smartwatch will automatically detect and add your activities to your Google Fit journal to ensure you get credit for every move. Enjoy a different type of workout? Select it from a list of activities like pilates, rowing, or spinning, and Google Fit will track all the Heart Points you earn.

CONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES

Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices to give you a holistic view of your health, so you'll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Wear OS by Google, Nike+, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Basis, Sleep as Android, Withings, Xiaomi Mi bands, and more.

com.amazon.healthtech.malibu,"This app requires the Halo Band.

Amazon Halo measures your movement, sleep quality, body composition, and even the tone of your voice, to provide a more complete picture of your overall health and help you build better habits for life.

Key features:

ACTIVITY

• Informed by guidelines from the American Heart Association, Halo measures the intensity of your activity in addition to tracking steps and sedentary time. This means that working harder – for example, taking two stairs at a time, or going for a jog – helps you reach your weekly goals faster.


SLEEP

• Monitor the quality and quantity of your sleep, like how long it takes you to fall asleep, how much you wake up at night, and how long you spend in each sleep stage.


BODY COMPOSITION

• Halo's Body feature is nearly twice as accurate as leading at-home smart scales.
• Body uses your smartphone’s camera to determine your body fat percentage, a better indicator of health than weight or BMI alone.
• A personalized 3D model helps you track changes over time.


LABS

• Build healthier habits through 100+ labs developed by partners like Mayo Clinic, WW and Headspace.
• Simple, trackable experiments and challenges can help you see the impact that small changes can make on the way you feel – like whether meditating improves your focus, or if a pet-free bedroom improves your sleep quality.


TONE OF VOICE ANALYSIS

• Halo analyzes qualities of your voice throughout the day to help you understand how you may sound to others.
• Being more aware of your tone can help you keep your relationships strong at home, at work, and everywhere in between.

Effectively manage data
Add or copy your apps and data into Secure Folder. You can use Secure Folder to store your private contacts, photos, and more in a separate account. This allows you to have two profiles on a device so you can manage your data more effectively.

※ Secure Folder will operate only on official software released by Samsung Electronics. Features or UX may vary depending on the device, OS version, etc.

Applications and data moved or added to Secure Folder (e.g. photos, audio files, movie files, and documents), will not be accessible from outside Secure Folder, whether by USB or Wi-Fi Direct. If your mobile device detects any rooting or custom ROMs, Secure Folder will automatically lock-up in order to prevent unauthorised access, in which case you will no longer be able to access or use the contents within Secure Folder. Therefore, please make sure you back up any important applications or data elsewhere, such as on your personal computer, before moving them to Secure Folder.

When the feature is set, a thin gesture handle is added to the left/right side of the screen. 
Swipe this handle to execute the defined functions. The default function is the most frequently used back button.

You can set various functions for horizontal/diagonal up/down diagonal gestures.
Once you get used to using short swipe gestures, you can set more features for long swipe gestures.

Depending on the size of your hand, the thickness of your thumb, or the shape of the bumper case you are using, different handle settings are provided to optimize gesture recognition.

The handle receives the user's touch event on top of the running app. It can interfere with running applications. Therefore, it is recommended to set the handle as thin as possible for gesture recognition. 

If the touch interference is severe with running application such as game, you can set [App exceptions] in [Advanced Settings], then the gesture handles will not work when the app is running.

Currently available functions are as follows, and we plan to provide additional function upgrades.

com.azure.authenticator,"Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.

Getting started with multi-factor authentication

Multi factor authentication (MFA) or two factor authentication (2FA) provides a second layer of security. When logging in with multi-factor authentication, you’ll enter your password, and then you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The one-time passwords (OTP codes) have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The one-time password (OTP) doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.

Getting started with passwordless

Use your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.

Getting started with autofill

Microsoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.

Microsoft personal, work or school accounts

Sometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.
